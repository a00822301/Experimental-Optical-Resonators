# Experimental-Optical-Resonators
The objective of this project is to find a numerical solution for the diffraction integral of a stable cavity optical resonator.
Using the gauleg.m function to find the weights and abscissa for the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, we obtained some values of the Bessel function and compared against the MATLAB routine. 
Finally, we obtained the egienmodes of th stable optical resonator, formed by an axicon and spherical mirror. 
The report was made in collaboration with the team, my main contribution consisted in setting up the code and evaluating the validity of our results.
